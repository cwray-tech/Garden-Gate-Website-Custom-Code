# Custom Code for Garden Gate Nursery's Website

This is the custom code written for [Garden Gate Nursery's website](https://gardengatetrees.com) that is hosted on Webflow.
In order to better maintain and update the code, it is hosted on Github and Github pages to be able to quickly commit changes to the site without having to use the Webflow custom code area.

## Some integrations with Webflow

- Algolia search for searching plants in the catalog.
- Custom search on plant pages with javascript.
- Blog search on blog index page for easily searching blogs.

## Why Webflow

Garden Gate's website is hosted on Webflow so that we can quickly update the design and content of the site. It is a pretty cool cms.

If you want to take a look at Webflow, I would love it if you used [my referal link](https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3714200.2671db&utm_medium=affiliate). (I  get a little money if you sign up for a plan.)

## Why Share this

This is public in the browser and none of the code is private. I wanted to put this on Github because I needed to host the files somewhere and I like Github. Using Github pages was the fastest way to serve the javascript to the site.
